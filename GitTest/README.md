# README

This repository contains three small projects located in the **src** folder:

1. **ap_prediction_automation**: This project includes code to gather, clean, and parse data for the AP prediction problem. It utilizes XGBoost to generate predictions and also features several 2D and 3D visualizations.

2. **sionna-simulation**: This project implements a simulation that places *n* cubes within a specified Blender 3D scene. It uses Sionna to compute signal propagation of access points (APs) in the environment. The results are translated from Grafana into 3D Blender objects and incorporated into the scene. The output is saved in various file formats.

3. **grafana-plugin**: This project consists of a Grafana plugin designed to visualize the results from the Sionna simulation directly on the Grafana dashboard.

In the **src** folder, there are also two additional folders containing code for experiments related to AP location and Sionna simulations.

The **study notes** folder includes documentation detailing the processes followed to achieve the results.
