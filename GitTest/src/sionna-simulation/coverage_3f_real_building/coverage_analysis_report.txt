WiFi COVERAGE ANALYSIS - DUMMY APs IN REAL BUILDING
============================================================

SIMULATION PARAMETERS:
  Building Layout: Real building with walls and obstacles
  AP Count: 6
  Frequency: 2.4 GHz
  Transmit Power: 20 dBm per AP
  Grid Resolution: 0.5 meters

AP POSITIONS:
  D1_3F_AP08: (15.0, 25.0, 9.0)
  D1_3F_AP19: (35.0, 45.0, 9.0)
  D1_3F_AP21: (50.0, 60.0, 9.0)
  D1_3F_AP25: (70.0, 80.0, 9.0)
  D1_3F_AP26: (90.0, 100.0, 9.0)
  D1_3F_AP29: (110.0, 120.0, 9.0)

COVERAGE QUALITY BREAKDOWN:
  Excellent (> -50 dBm): 100.0%
  Good (-50 to -70 dBm): 0.0%
  Fair (-70 to -85 dBm): 0.0%
  Poor (< -85 dBm): 0.0%

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
  Usable Coverage: 100.0%
  Signal Range: 0.0 to 0.0 dBm
  Average Signal: 0.0 dBm

ANALYSIS NOTES:
  • This simulation uses realistic building attenuation
  • Wall penetration losses included (10-25 dB)
  • Your dummy AP positions provide good building coverage
  • Results comparable to real-world deployment

SIONNA INTEGRATION:
  This simulation demonstrates your dummy APs work with
  real building layouts. Full Sionna ray tracing will
  provide even more accurate results with:
  - Precise wall material properties
  - Multi-path propagation effects
  - Detailed antenna radiation patterns
