TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Integration Method:
  • Blender geometry exported to PLY format
  • Manual XML scene file creation for Sionna
  • WiFi-appropriate materials applied (concrete, drywall)
  • Real AP coordinates integrated from CSV files

Ray Tracing Benefits:
  • Accounts for building reflections and diffractions
  • More accurate shadow regions behind walls
  • Realistic multipath propagation modeling
  • Better prediction of coverage gaps

Key Findings:
  • Real building geometry successfully integrated
  • AP placement provides good overall coverage
  • Ray tracing shows more realistic coverage patterns
  • Building structure significantly affects signal propagation
  • Manual XML approach reliable for complex geometries

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
1. AP Optimization:
   • Current AP placement provides good coverage
   • Consider additional APs in identified weak areas
   • Optimize AP heights for better coverage

2. Technical Improvements:
   • Use ray tracing for most accurate predictions
   • Export detailed building materials from Blender
   • Consider directional antennas for specific areas

3. Future Analysis:
   • Analyze multiple floors simultaneously
   • Include furniture and detailed interior structures
   • Perform interference analysis between APs
